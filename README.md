## PLP2 (Swift)

### 1. What are the naming requirements for variables in your language? a. What about naming conventions? Are they enforced by the compiler/interpreter, or are they just standards in the community?

##### Naming Requirements:
* Variables must start with either a letter or an underscore, which can then be followed by other letters, underscores, and digits. 
* Swift is case-sensitive, so "myName" and "MyName" are different names. 
* Variable names cannot include whitespace characters, math symbols, or arrows.

###### **Naming Conventions:** 
* Swift follows camelCase convention for naming variables. 
* For constants and variables, camel case is used with a lowercase letter first (for example, "myName").
* For types and protocols, camel case is used with a uppercase letter first (for example, "MyName")
* Variables are first initialized by using "var".

### 2. Is your language statically or dynamically typed? 
##### Swift is statically typed. All information must be given to the compiler before compile time.

### 3. Strongly typed or weakly typed? 
##### Swift is strongly typed.
